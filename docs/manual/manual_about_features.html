    				<p class="lead">
    					<b>XWOS</b> introduces a complete sandbox. That means that all applications and even user sessions are isolated processes.
    					They are not allowed to communicate but over a secure API. One process may not change code or data of another processes.
    					As an end user you can create a more secure computer and allowing guests to use it. 
    				</p>
    				<p class="lead">
    					From developers point of view the lua api is very "simple". It is not very handy to write real process related tasks.
    					I am solving this by introducing process hierarchy, IPC (inter process communication) and threads.
    					And all is written in LUA and coroutine. Applications still should call yield whenever possible.

    				<p class="lead">
    					A Security manager is used to control the access to resources and APIs. This does not only provide a simple login system.
    					Instead it covers following topics known from modern systems like windows or linux.
    				</p>
    				<ul>
    					<li>Multiple access levels (root, administrator, user, guest)</li>
    					<li>File/ directory ownership and ACL</li>
    					<li>Per process ACL and application profiles, f.e. an app requesting control over turtle movement. <b>XWOS</b> will request the user to login with administrator account for granting access. "Run as administrator"...</li>

    				<p class="lead">
    					The multi tasking is still based on lua coroutine. But there are important improvements for ComputerCraft: The event system will be rewritten.
    					Each process gets its own event queue. That's really important when multiple processes need special events, for example multiple processes go to sleep.
    					No more deadlocks, no more problems on multiple apps.

    				<p class="lead">
    					Writing <b>XWOS</b> apps will require to use some application description. You are forces to have version numbers, a common file layout and some other things.
    					All of these requirements leads us to have a more finer control over what is installed and which user is allowed to use it.
    					As a computer user You already know it from every modern operating system. You always are able to see what is installed and to manually uninstall or upgrade it.
    				</p>
    				<p class="lead">
    					Another task is to support computer disks to distribute applications and upgrades to computers. Think of some adventure where one first gets a small app and
    					has to earn newer versions by giving some diamonds to NPCs.
    				</p>
    				<p class="lead">
    					You may still be able to use other code outside <b>XWOS</b>.

    					Hibernate applications is very complicated. However <b>XWOS</b> provides a clean way fpr applications to remember their state during server shutdown.
    					Persistent apps are restarted as soon as the server is restarted. This is very useful for single player mode or for tablets. No more dead turtles somewhere
    					on their way.

    					A special cloud service will be included, supporting multiple computer Networks and clouds.
    					Setup a new computer/turtle via disk, installing from a "cloud server".
    					Using remote Desktops etc. in your cloud and even write cloud aware applications.
    				</p>
    				<p class="lead">
    					First app will be a "mining turtle Garage". A Cloud Server will Control the mining turtles and once they done their work, they will go back to garage, getting refueled and waiting for new orders.
    					On your pocket computer you can add tasks to a mining queue to get some free turtle and let
    					it start mining on the players position.
    				</p>
    				<p class="lead">
    					Maybe someone can program a drone turtle to let you "buy" items in the minecraft "online shop" and let a free turtle deliver it to your position...
